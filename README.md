The Black Lives Matter movement was organized with the goal of building and supporting local communities to empower the virtues of equality and equity. Prominent in today's society, many individuals and organization, regardless of background and character, are committed to the contributing to the movement. However, many are simply not in a position to donate monetarily. That's where BLMCoin comes in.

BLMCoin (BLMC) is a decentralized donation cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum Blockchain network specifically engineered to support equality and social justice through the Black Lives Matter movement. BLMCoin utilizes unused processing power to mine BLMC, which is private and secure by nature. BLMCoin is exchanged for USD and donated to various BLM charities. BLMCoin betters society by allowing for the contribution to a meaningful cause with no cost and from the comforts of home.
